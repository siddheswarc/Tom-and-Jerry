# Tom-and-Jerry-in-Reinforcement-Learning

This project combines Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. The task is to teach the agent to navigate in the grid-world environment.

We have modeled Tom and Jerry cartoon, where Tom, a cat, is chasing Jerry, a mouse. In our modeled game the task for Tom (an agent) is to find the shortest path to Jerry (a goal), given that the initial positions of Tom and Jerry are changing on every reset of the game.

To solve the problem, we would apply Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm - DQN (Deep Q-Network), that was one of the first breakthrough successes in applying Deep Learning to Reinforcement Learning.
